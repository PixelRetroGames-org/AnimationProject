# AnimationProject
The Great Animation Project for Game Designers (Made by Alex Cioltan)
This program can be used to make short animations. To use it change the setting in the "settings.txt" file.
The "settings.txt" file contains:
NUMBER_OF_FRAMES SPEED
PREFIX_OF_IMAGES
Your images must be named PREFIX_OF_IMAGESx.bmp where x is 1,2,3...,NUMBER_OF_FRAMES.
Hope you can make it useful.
